# Parallel Task Scheduling for Deadline-Oriented Systems

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop an efficient task scheduling system that considers team members' working hours, deadlines, and dependencies between tasks. The primary goal is to transition from a sequential execution model to a parallel processing model, thereby enhancing performance and reducing overall execution time.

---

##  Objective 

- ** Measure the performance of the sequential code to identify the execution time, the most time-consuming part of the code and the parts to be parallelized.
- ** Develop a parallel code version that uses multiple processing units to improve performance. 
- **Text-to-Speech Audio**: compare the performance of the sequential and parallel code to assess improvements in execution time and efficiency.

## Sequential Benchmarking 

| Number of Tasks | Execution Time (seconds) |
|------------------|--------------------------|
| 100              | 0.017000                 |
| 500              | 0.122000                 |
| 1000             | 0.328000                 |
| 2000             | 1.166000                 |
| 3000             | 2.633000                 |
